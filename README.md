## Hyperblog by David Vega ðŸ‘‹

This project has been created as practice for the course "Curso Profesional de Git y GitHub" taken at Platzi following the original teacher Freddy's project for the content of the class on [Freddier/hyperblog](https://github.com/freddier/hyperblog) (with some personal variations for sure).Content of this course were the following


- All Git comands.
- Git Workflow 
- Tips related with good practices
- Branches and Tags
- Examples on WIndow, Linux and Mac
-- I have worked on Linux

I hope i'll have the opportunity to get your attention over this and future projects on my Github that allow you to have a better understanding of the things I can do as a programer.
